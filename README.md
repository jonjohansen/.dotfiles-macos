## Requirements

To be able to install the dotfiles, you are going to need `git` and various developer tools. These are shipped with the macos **command-line-tools.** To install these run:

```
xcode-select --install
```

You also need to have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed. Follow instructions on their website to get started.

## Installation

The dotfiles are configured to be installed under `~/.dotfiles-macos/`by default and should be cloned into `$HOME`.
**See** [location](#Location) to change this.

1. Clone this repository with:

```
git clone https://github.com/jonjohansen/.dotfiles-macos.git ~/.dotfiles-macos
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Beware that some of the settings (especially those for [macos](.macos)) may require `sudo` privileges.

2. Run the python installation script

```
python3 install.py
```

## Customize

Everything can be customized, and it is recommended to get an overlook of what the dotfiles install and adjust them to preferred settings.

### Location

If you want to install the dotfiles somewhere else some paths are dependent on the DOTFILES variable.

in **`.zshrc`**

```
export DOTFILES="$HOME/.dotfiles-macos/"
```

> [!NOTE]
> There also is a reference to `$DOTFILES` in `install.py` which will have to be updated.
